SUMMARY
----------

OneCheck is a simple interview test question system (a bit like the oDesk tests), based on Ruby On Rails.
OneCheck is developed as Demo example in ROR technogy which I love.

Demo application: 
   http://onecheck.heroku.com


REQUIREMENTS
---------------

1. Capture contact details

  - Name
  - Skype ID
  - Email
  - Country

2. Time the test

Make an admin area where we can enter questions with the option to choose 3 types of answer format:
  - multi choice 
  - exact answer (what is 1 + 1  requires ‘2’ to get a correct result) 
  - Text area - for free form answers questions like ‘Review this code’

3. There is an interface where the author can see and compare results.

TECHNICAL SOLUTION

- Rails 3.x
